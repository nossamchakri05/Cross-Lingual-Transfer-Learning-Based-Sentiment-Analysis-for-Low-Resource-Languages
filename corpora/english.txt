Greece is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States
A contiguous suburb of Rochester, it is the largest town by population in Monroe County and the second-largest municipality by population in the county, behind only the city of Rochester
As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 96,926
== History ==


=== Prehistory ===
Indigenous tribes had settled the area surrounding the Finger Lakes and moved northward to Lake Ontario, the Genesee River, Irondequoit Bay, and the ponds of Greece as early as 1300 AD
These people were Iroquoian tribes, early cousins of the Seneca, who traded with the Algonquin and Huron tribes
By about 1550 AD the Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga and Onondaga combined to form the Iroquois Confederacy
(The Tuscarora would later migrate from the Carolinas and join the Confederacy
) They remained the dominant inhabitants of the region for the next 200 years
=== European contact ===
The first European to visit the area was the French explorer La Salle, who visited in 1669
French and British soldiers passed through on multiple occasions during this time period as the two colonial powers struggled for control of the region
European settlers began to arrive in the area in the late 1790s, after the land was formally purchased from the Seneca people
=== Early settlement ===
Following the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, the new government was keen to enable its citizens to make use of the new vast regions to the west
In 1792, the first settlers in what would become the town of Greece arrived
William Hincher (a Revolutionary War veteran and a participant in Shays's Rebellion), his wife Mehitable, and their eight children built a cabin on the west bank of the Genesee River and purchased 627 acres (254 ha) of land in present-day Charlotte in 1794
Following William's death in 1817, a deed was created between Mehitable and the United States government for the establishment of the Charlotte–Genesee Lighthouse on the property, which was constructed in 1822
In 1797, Kings Landing—the first European settlement and port west of the Genesee River—was established by the King and Granger families (natives of Suffield, Connecticut) on the bank of the Genesee in what is the present-day neighborhood of Charlotte in Rochester
The Grangers were related patrilineally to Gideon Granger, whose home in nearby Canandaigua is a museum
The Kings Landing settlement survived until it was decimated by malaria, then known as "Genesee Fever"
In 1807 the settlement was revived by the seven Hanford brothers (and renamed "Hanford's Landing"), who constructed a mill, hotel and shipping center on the land
In 1805, James and Sarah Latta (natives of Big Flats) purchased large plots of land in Charlotte for their family
The following year, their son Samuel built a home and warehouse on the property and was appointed customs agent for the Port of Charlotte by the President of the United States
The home built by Samuel Latta still stands at the intersection of Lake Ave and Latta Road
=== Greece in the War of 1812 ===
On October 1, 1812, the British warship H
Royal George waded at the mouth of the Genesee River
Seventy British marines entered the harbor and seized a United States revenue cutter, a vessel named the Lady Murray, and a privately owned schooner
The following day the British returned as the riggings for the Lady Murray were kept in a storehouse at the Commercial Hotel operated by Erastus Spaulding (on a site near the present-day intersection of Stutson Street and River Street in Charlotte) and seized the missing equipment along with two gallons of whiskey
On June 15, 1813, after learning that provisions for American troops were being stored at Charlotte, a fleet of eight British vessels under the command of Commodore James Yeo entered the Genesee River
150 British sailors came ashore and seized the provisions along with a sloop which belonged to Erastus Spaulding
To prevent the people of Charlotte from alerting the militia, the British troops rounded them up and locked them overnight in a building owned by Frederick Bushnell and the Samuel Latta Home
A couple of men who managed to evade capture alerted the militia which was gathered at the Steamboat Hotel in Hanford's Landing (a distance of about 7 miles (11 km))
Under the command of Colonel Caleb Hopkins the militia marched to Charlotte and arrived just in time to see the British vessels sailing away
On September 11, 1813, the American fleet under the command of Commodore Isaac Chauncey caught up with the British fleet at Braddock Bay, in the northwest corner of present-day Greece
At 2:30 pm offshore of Charlotte, the American fleet began closing in and came within three-quarters of a mile of the enemy ships, putting them within long gun range
The USS Pike and the USS Sylph bombarded the British fleet with cannon fire for 90 minutes, but due to the poor maneuverability of the American ships the British were able to escape
On May 15, 1814, British ships anchored off the shore of Charlotte were spotted by Colonel Isaac Stone
Thirty-three men from Greece, Gates, Rochester and Brighton gathered at the Hanford Inn and marched through the night, arriving at the mouth of the Genesee River at dawn
Due to heavy fog the British believed a much larger force was gathered on the shore
Stone refused initial demands of truce, which were to surrender the provisions being stored at Charlotte
In response the British dispatched a gunboat to the harbor
Stone wanted to capture the boat, but his militia prematurely fired their cannon
The British fired 15-20 shots in return, striking a warehouse
That afternoon, General Peter Porter and the militias under the commands of Colonel Caleb Hopkins, Colonel John Atchinson and Captain Frederick Rose (600-800 men in total) arrived in Charlotte
The British sent a second truce and threatened to land an army and 400 warriors from Tecumseh's confederacy if they did not comply
General Porter again refused the demands and warned that if the British landed "they would be taken care of"
Not knowing how many men were defending Charlotte, Yeo and his ships sailed away on the morning of May 16, 1814
=== Establishment of the Town of Greece ===
During the late 18th century, counties were established to provide support to the western frontier of New York state
By 1789 Ontario and Genesee counties had been established, and in 1797 a region called Northampton had been designated in the eastern portion of Genesee County on land that had been acquired through the Phelps & Gorham land purchase
Northampton encompassed the area of present-day Parma, Riga, Gates, Ogden, Chili, and Greece
In 1808, Northampton was divided into four towns
The area that is present-day Gates and Greece maintained the name Northampton until the town of Gates was formally established in 1813
In 1821, Monroe County was created from land of both Ontario and Genesee counties
On March 22, 1822, the state government passed legislation which, effective April 1, 1822, divided Gates into the modern towns of Gates and Greece
The town of Greece received a larger percentage of the land because it was believed that most of the northern portion of the town was unusable swamp land
The name Greece was selected in support of the contemporary Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire
=== 1822-present ===
The portion of the Erie Canal which passes through the town of Greece was completed by 1822
The hamlet of "South Greece" (present-day Henpeck Park at the intersection of Ridgeway Avenue and Elmgrove Road) was established to facilitate the needs of travelers and workers on the canal
Some of the stone masons who came from Europe to help build the canal remained in the area and are thought to be responsible for the construction of cobblestone homes which are somewhat unique to the Central and Western New York region
Three such structures remain in the town as of 2024, including the Covert-Brodie-Pollok House on North Greece Road
Throughout the 19th century Greece was primarily a farming community with a population that hovered around 5,000 people, and additional hamlets such as North Greece, West Greece, Greece Center, Barnard Crossing and Paddy Hill were formed
Much of the economic activity in the town centered on the port of Charlotte, which was incorporated as a village within the town of Greece in 1869, and facilitated up to 100 ships in the port and along the Genesee River in a day
The town’s proximity to Lake Ontario made it a famous vacation destination in the latter portion of the 19th century
The Ontario Beach Amusement Park (operating from 1884-1919), located on the site of the present-day Ontario Beach Park, was known as the "Coney Island of the West"
Another amusement park at Manitou Beach (operating from the 1890s to the 1920s) was connected to Charlotte via the Grand View Beach Railway, and grand resort hotels such as the Manitou Hotel, Crescent Beach Hotel and the Odenbach Hotel sprang up along the route to accommodate visitors
The Dentzel Menagerie Carousel, a reminder of the amusement parks' heyday, still operates at Ontario Beach Park
It was around this same time that the economy of Greece began to shift from agriculture to industry
In 1891, George Eastman opened the first Kodak plant in the southeast area of town (at the intersection of Mount Read Boulevard and West Ridge Road) that would eventually become known as Kodak Park
Kodak would eventually become the largest employer in the greater Rochester region, and its success is directly responsible for the town's growth
As the city of Rochester expanded, it annexed large portions of the town
Charlotte was annexed in 1916 (creating the city's 23rd Ward), and the industrial district of Kodak Park was annexed in 1918
This economic shift continued steadily throughout the interwar period
It was during this time that weather extremes, such as a severe freeze in 1934 which destroyed many of the town's orchards, resulted in a devastating loss of crops that many farmers were not able to recover from
As a result, much of the farm land was sold for real estate development
Due to its proximity to Kodak Park, the town transformed as residential construction to support soldiers returning from World War II attracted large numbers of factory workers and their families to Greece
The population grew rapidly during this time, from roughly 15,000 people in 1940 to almost 50,000 by 1960, and by 1967 the population was approaching 75,000
== Geography ==


=== The Ridge ===
At the end of the last ice age, around 11,000 BCE, much of the land making up the town of Greece was covered by a prehistoric lake which was created by glacial ice sheets that prevented the lake from draining via the St Lawrence River as it does today
This lake, known as Lake Iroquois, was in essence an enlargement of present-day Lake Ontario
As the glaciers receded, the waters of Lake Iroquois began to drop to modern levels, leaving behind a ridge of land roughly 7 to 7
1 km) from the current shoreline and rising to about 400 feet (120 m) above sea level, roughly 160 feet (49 m) above Lake Ontario
The soil deposited in these receded regions was rich and fertile for agricultural purposes
This ridge had long been used by Native Americans as a footpath and to this day it is the main thoroughfare of the town, known to locals colloquially as "the Ridge"
Sometime between 1801 and 1804, anticipating that the Ridge would become a major thoroughfare, Abel Rowe opened a tavern on Ridge Road
For some time it was one of only two buildings on the Ridge between the Genesee River and Lewiston (on the Niagara River)
During the War of 1812 the Ridge served as an important route for transporting troops and supplies across Western New York, and in 1813 New York State appropriated $5,000 for improvements to the roadway
In 1816, stagecoaches began traveling on Ridge Road and would continue to be a major mode of transportation for decades
More taverns and general stores sprang up, often near the hamlets that formed at various points along the Ridge
By the middle of the 19th century, Ridge Road was lined with prosperous farms and mansions such as the Todd Mansion (at the intersection of West Ridge Road and North Ave) and the Upton Mansion (present day Ridgemont Country Club)
In the 1860s a portion of Ridge Road between Long Pond Road and Elmgrove Road was planked, similar to a boardwalk
However, the majority of the Ridge remained a dirt road until the beginning of the 20th century
In 1900, Ridge Road became New York State Route 104, and money was appropriated for its improvement
As automobiles gained popularity there was less need for many of the taverns and hotels along the Ridge
Blacksmiths and carriage makers made way for gas stations and repair shops
Route 104 was rebuilt in 1926 to better accommodate travel by motorcar
By the 1940s thousands of Greece residents were traveling along the Ridge daily to work at Kodak, often causing it to become congested
The Ridge was widened in 1956 (four lanes), again in 1978 (six lanes), and again in 2008 (six to eight lanes, plus medians)
The last of the early taverns on the Ridge, Streb's Steak House, was torn down in 2013
Today shopping plazas, chain restaurants and car dealerships line both sides of Ridge Road
=== Present day ===
The town is located west of the Genesee River in central Monroe County, and is bordered by the city of Rochester to the east, the town of Gates to the south, the towns of Parma and Ogden to the west, and Lake Ontario to the north
New York State Route 104 (Ridge Road) crosses the southern part of the town, passing through the town center and leading east into Rochester and west 12 miles (19 km) to Clarkson
State Route 18 (Latta Road) passes through North Greece, leading east and then south into Rochester and northwest 5 miles (8 km) to Hilton
The Lake Ontario State Parkway runs through the northern part of town, about a mile inland from the shore of the lake
Interstate 390 runs north-south through the eastern part of town
Census Bureau, the town of Greece has a total area of 51
4 square miles (133 km2), of which 47
5 square miles (123 km2) are land and 3
Wetlands and numerous ponds such as Cranberry Pond, Long Pond and Braddock Bay cover the northernmost portion of the town of Greece along the shoreline of Lake Ontario
This area has the lowest elevation in the town, sitting 243 feet (74 m) above sea level
The highest elevation in the town of Greece is south of Ridgeway Avenue along Interstate 390, the current location of BJ's Wholesale Club, sitting 558 feet (170 m) above sea level

The town is governed by a town board consisting of a supervisor and four council members
The supervisor is elected by all registered voters in the town, while council members are elected by and represent one of four wards
Supervisors are elected for four-year terms, and by town law may not serve for more than twelve years consecutively, after which the individual is ineligible to serve for four years
Councilpersons are elected for two-year terms, and may serve for a maximum of ten consecutive years in that position
The town board's practice of opening each meeting with a prayer, which started in 1999, was legally challenged in 2008, on the grounds that all prayers offered to open the meetings had, until that point, been Christian ones
The United States District Court, Western District of New York, ruled in favor of the town in 2010, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in 2012, setting the stage for a 2014 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled in favor of the town (see Town of Greece v
The town is also represented in congress by three different representatives, the State Assembly Representative, State Senatorial Representative and the Congressional Representative
The town's New York State Assembly Representative is Josh Jensen who  represents the towns of Greece, Ogden and Parma
The town's New York State Senatorial Representative is Jeremy Cooney who represents the Towns of Brighton, Clarkson, Gates, Greece, Hamlin, Parma, as well as parts of the City of Rochester, including Charlotte, Historic Maplewood and the University of Rochester
The town's United States Congressional Representative is Joseph Morelle who was elected on November 6, 2018 replacing the late Representative Louise Slaughter, who had served as the United States representative for the 25th congressional district of New York from 1987 until her death in early 2018
He represents all of Monroe County except for the towns of Mendon, Rush, Hamlin, Wheatland, and one election district in the town of Clarkson
Six of the 29 districts of the Monroe County Legislature include portions of Greece
== Education ==
Education in the Town of Greece dates back to at least 1798 when the residents of then Northampton elected the first school commissioner
In 1823, a year after its founding, the Town of Greece was divided into Common School Districts
By the end of the 19th century the town had seventeen Common School Districts, as well as two Joint School Districts on the Greece / Parma town border
During this time the districts were repeatedly renumbered and restructured as the population of students in the town grew
Common School District #15 - Barnard School is the only building still functioning as a school
It is currently occupied by Derech HaTorah, a private Jewish school
Centralization of the Common School Districts began in 1928 with the consolidation of districts 3, 11 and 16 which were combined to form Greece Central School District #1 - Hoover Drive
Greece was the first centralized school district in Monroe County and the thirteenth centralized school district in New York State
As the population expanded rapidly following World War II, the Greece Central School district grew to accommodate its growing number of students
The first secondary school in town following the annexation of Charlotte was Olympia High School which opened in 1959
Prior to the construction of Olympia the only secondary schools serving residents of the Town of Greece were Charlotte High School and John Marshall High School in the City of Rochester
Over the next 10 years two more secondary schools would follow; Arcadia High School (1963), and Athena High School (1969)
The Hoover Drive School was eventually transformed to the Odyssey Academy before relocating to the site of the former Cardinal Mooney High School in 2012 following the consolidation of Apollo Middle School — which had previously occupied the Cardinal Mooney building — and Olympia High School
Today there are three school districts serving the Town of Greece: the Greece Central School District, the Hilton Central School District and the Spencerport Central School District
The schools of the Greece Central School District educate approximately 11,000 students
Excluding New York City, the Greece Central School District is the seventh largest school district in the State of New York
The post-elementary schools have Classical Greek names and mascots
Private sources of education within the Town of Greece include the Greece Montessori School, Rochester Academy Charter High School, Dorech HaTorah Jewish School and St

The black-tailed rattlesnake (Crotalus molossus) is a venomous pit viper species found in the southwestern United States and Mexico
Four subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here
== Taxonomy ==
A 2012 revision  showed that eastern populations from Texas and central and eastern New Mexico form a distinct species separate from C
Alternate common names are green rattler, and Northern black-tailed rattlesnake
=== Subspecies ===


== Description ==
 
This medium-sized species averages from 76 to 107 cm (30 to 42 in) in length
Large specimens are usually not much more than 100 cm (39 in) long, although lengths of 125
5 in) (Klauber, 1972), and 129
0 in) (Shaw & Campbell, 1974) have been reported
The females tend to be larger than the males
They range in color from  yellows and olive greens to browns and black
As their name implies, one of their most distinguishing features is, despite variations in body color, entirely black tail scales
Often, this rattlesnake has a black band across its eyes extending diagonally down to the corners of its mouth, forming a sort of facial 'mask'
molossus has a rattle composed of keratin on the end of its tail
Each time the snake sheds its skin, a new segment is added to the rattle
A snake can shed its skin several times a year, and the rattle is fairly fragile and can be broken, so that the length of a rattlesnake's rattle is not an accurate measure of its age, unless the terminal button is intact
== Distribution and habitat ==
The black-tailed rattlesnake is found in the southwestern United States in Arizona, New Mexico and west and central Texas, and Mexico as far south as Oaxaca, as well as the Gulf of California on San Estéban and Tiburón Islands
Its distribution reaches a maximum elevation of 2930 m, although it has been recorded at as high as 6900 feet at the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains of west Texas
The type locality given is "Fort Webster, St
" (Fort Webster, Santa Rita del Cobre, Grant County, New Mexico, USA)
== Behavior and ecology ==
All rattlesnakes are carnivorous, their primary food sources being rodents, other small mammals, birds, and small reptiles (such as small lizards)
The behavior of northern black-tailed rattlesnakes varies over the course of a year
In the spring and fall, they are primarily diurnal
In the summer, they shift to a nocturnal behavior, to avoid the heat of summer
In the winter, they hibernate in dens created and abandoned by other animals, often with other species of snakes
They are variable in their form of locomotion depending on what substrate they need to traverse and will actively change between sidewinding or rectilinear movement
Although it is an able climber and expert swimmer, C
molossus is primarily a terrestrial species and inhabits grasslands, desert areas, and rocky and mountainous areas, as well as high-altitude forests
=== Docility and defense ===
Crotalus molossus is considered to be one of the most docile rattlesnakes because of its calm demeanor and curious nature
The snake relies mostly on camouflage to avoid discovery
It normally tries to slither away when confronted, but will rattle when cornered
=== Venom ===
The venom of the C
molossus is primarily hemotoxic, like that of most crotalids
However, it is only about two-thirds as toxic as western diamondback venom and is generally not fatal to humans
CroFab antivenom is often used to treat bites
Crotalus molossus has larger venom glands than most rattlesnakes in its region
Because its venom is less toxic than that of most other crotalids, it needs to inject large quantities into its prey to be effective
=== Reproduction ===
Breeding occurs in the spring when males follow the pheromone trails of the females
Copulation can sometimes last for hours and occur multiple times over a period of days
After mating, the male often stays near the female for several days to prevent any other males from mating with her
The female gives birth to live young in the summer, and the babies stay with the mother only until they wander off on their own, usually in less than a day or two
Females are believed to breed every year, and can have litters as large as 10-12 young but usually averaging four to six
== Conservation status ==
This species is classified as Least Concern IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v3
Species are listed as such owing to their wide distribution or presumed large population or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category
The population trend was stable when assessed in 2007

Pityrodia chrysocalyx is a flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia
It is an erect, bushy shrub with small, glossy leaves, and flowers with white petals and a golden-yellow calyx
== Description ==
Pityrodia chrysocalyx is an erect, bushy, compact shrub which grows to a height of 30–75 cm (10–30 in) with its branches densely covered with reddish yellow, circular scales
Its leaves are glossy green, egg-shaped 2–6 cm (0
8–2 in) long, 1–3 mm (0
1 in) wide and usually scattered in groups of three along the stems
The flowers are arranged singly in upper leaf axils on a very short stalk
There is a leaf-like bract and minute bracteoles at the base of the flower
The five sepals are joined to form a golden-coloured, bell-shaped tube 5–7 mm (0
3 in) long, scaly on the outside but glabrous inside
The five petals are joined to form a white tube 9–12 mm (0
5 in) long with five lobes on the end
The tube is wider at the top end and the lower, middle lobe is broad elliptic to almost circular, 3–5 mm (0
2 in) broad and long while the other four lobes are slightly smaller and roughly similar in size and shape to each other
The petal tube has a few soft hairs on the outside but glabrous inside apart from a densely hairy ring above the ovary and a few hairs on the large petal lobe
Flowering occurs from July to October and is followed by a hairy, oval fruit 4–5 mm (0
20 in) long with the sepals attached
== Taxonomy and naming ==
This species was first formally described in 1876 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Depremesnilia chrysocalyx and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae
In 1931, Charles Gardner changed the name to Pityrodia chrysocalyx
The specific epithet (chrysocalyx) is derived from Ancient Greek words meaning "gold" and "cup", (to give "golden-cupped") referring to the colour of the sepal tube
== Distribution and habitat ==
This pityrodia grows in sandy loam in open woodland mainly between Esperance, Norseman, Lake Meads and Pyramid Lake in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions
== Conservation ==
Pityrodia chrysocalyx is classified as "Priority Three" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat

Anostoma, common name the up-mouth snails, is a genus of tropical air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Odontostomidae
Snails in this genus are found in Brazil
Adult snails in this genus have an extremely unusual shell morphology: the aperture of the adult shell faces directly "upwards", in other words, in the same direction as the spire
This seemingly impossible arrangement is made possible because the adult shell is carried upside down
In 1901, the American malacologist Henry Augustus Pilsbry commented that the adult shell of Anostoma is "so bizarre that in the total absence of information upon its life history, no useful theory can be formulated to account for its peculiarities
"
A very similar shell is found in the genus Ringicella Gray, 1847, which was previously considered to be merely a subgenus within Anostoma, but it is now considered to be a genus in its own right
== How the shell is carried ==

This is one of the most peculiar genera of land snails
The prominent feature of an upturned aperture (causing the adult snail to carry the shell spire down) is reflected in its scientific name Anostoma: ano, means up, or backwards, and stoma means mouth, from the Greek
In this genus, the adult snails carry the shell completely upside down, with the umbilicus uppermost, and the spire facing downwards
To make this extraordinary feat possible, the mature aperture of the shell is aligned in the same plane as the rather low spire of the shell
It appears that in juveniles, the shell is carried with the widest diameter vertically aligned, in other words, with the keel of the shell pointing up
== Shell description ==
The width of adult shells varies from 23 to 45 mm
Thomas Wyatt (1838) wrote about Anostoma: "An extraordinary shell, sometimes called the antique lamp from its form
Shell orbicular, the spire convex and obtuse; aperture round, toothed within, grinning, turned upward to the spire; margin reflected
"
The shell of Anostoma is heliciform, biconvex, solid, the axis hollow, but imperforate in the adult stage
The shell is composed of few whorls, the last straightened, turning toward the margin and upward
Before the last half whorl is formed, the shell is umbilicate, and judging by the growth-lines, the juvenile and subadult shell is carried with the equatorial plane nearly vertical
However, as the last half whorl starts to form, the direction of growth changes: it tilts to the right, not to the left as in the Helicidae, and subsequently that half whorl grows up across the base of the shell
The final aperture in the adult is slightly above the keel or widest diameter of the shell
The apex of the shell is smooth and somewhat flattened
The peristome is expanded and reflexed
The semicircular aperture is turned upward, obstructed by numerous lamellae and folds
In the aperture of Anostoma, the primitive condition of the parietal armature remains, the angular, parietal and infraparietal lamellae being all present and separate
In Anostoma the parietal lamella is the longest while in other Odontostomini the infraparietal lamella is the longest
The "teeth" of the aperture are entirely homologous with those of Odontostomus
The similar genus Ringicella has an additional feature on its shell: the angular lamella and upper suprapalatal fold are concrescent and form a perforation in the lip at its upper end
== Anatomy ==
Pilsbry described the anatomy of what is now known as Ringicella ringens
At the time that species was described as an Anostoma,  and Pilsbry (who was very thorough) did not make any comments that implied that there was any difference between the anatomy of that species and that of any of the other Anostoma species he examined
Anatomy of Anostoma depressum was examined by Harold Heath in 1914
== Distribution ==
This  genus of snails occurs in Brazil
== Species ==

Species within this genus include:

Anostoma baileyi Solem, 1956
Anostoma brunneum Verdcourt, 1991
Anostoma carinatum Pfeiffer, 1853
Anostoma depressum (Lamarck, 1822)
Anostoma deshayesianum Fischer, 1857
Anostoma octodentatum Fischer von Waldheim, 1807 - Brazilian up-mouth snail
This is the type species for the genus
The type locality is tropical South America, east of the Andes
Anostoma octodentatum verreauxianum Hupé, 1857 (photo)
Anostoma rossi Weber, 1925
Anostoma tessa Simone, 2012
Anostoma verreauxianum Hupé, 1856


== Synonyms ==

Very similar to the genus Anostoma, the taxon Ringicella is currently considered to be a genus in its own right
Species that are now in the genus Ringicella were previously included in the genus Anostoma
Synonyms:

Anostoma carinatum Pfeiffer, 1853 is now a synonym for Ringicella carinatum (Pfeiffer, 1853)
Anostoma luetzelburgi (Weber, 1925) is now a synonym for Ringicella luetzelburgi (Weber, 1925)
Anostoma ringens (Linnaeus, 1758), Anostoma globulosa Lamarck, 1822 and Anostoma globulosum Lamarck, 1822 are all synonyms for Ringicella ringens (Linnaeus, 1758)

Tamar Herman of Billboard called the track an "empowering anthem, introducing ITZY as a group that's an alternative to its peers," as well as "feisty and quick to shift tempos and genres," highlighting its "hip-hop breakdowns" throughout
IZM's Jeong Yeon-kyung stated that: "Dalla Dalla" borrows a dance beat in a ratchet style, exuding a YG atmosphere, and the personality of Red Velvet and F(x), represented by electronic sounds, comes out
The only choice for JYP style is the old-fashioned 'I'm different' narrative and the 'Gapbunpong (suddenly mood)' chorus, like Miss A's' "I Don't Need a Man", which eventually leads to the same woman with an arrow of blame
"  Writing for Kotaku, Seung Park judged it to be an "eclectic mashup of a mature version of some of Red Velvet's more esoteric work with Blackpink or 2NE1's hip-hop-esque aesthetic
" Park added that the song is a "solid opening bell of what is shaping up to be a long and interesting career
"
Taylor Glasby from Dazed ranked it eighth on their list of 2019's best K-pop songs, writing the song "evokes two outlandish 90s moments: the wobbly bass of
"Flat Beat" and the brat-pop of
" She added, "Like the latter, "Dalla Dalla" owes more to its artists' personalities, and despite several coats of K-pop polish, embodies that same scrappy energy and ballsy confidence

The John Haimbaugh Round Barn in Newcastle Township near Rochester, Indiana, United States, is a round barn that was built in 1914
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993
There was another 2-pitch gambrel barn in Rochester Township, built in 1915, that was still extant at the time of a 1991 survey of round barns in the state
Also in the township there had been a 3-pitch gambrel barn built in 1916, but the latter has been lost
: 40 
Brothers Vernon, Oral, and Hap Kindig built the barn in 1914 for Mr
It stands on the west side of Indiana 25
The barn is surrounded by mature trees with cultivated fields on the north and west
== Exterior ==
The 72-foot (22 m) diameter circle is two-story structure, surrounded on the northwest by a 20-foot (6
1 m) semi-circular one story shed
The roof is a three-pitch gambrel with a dormer on the northeast
In lieu of a cupola, it has a metal aerator
The shed is covered by a gently sloping roof
The balloon framing of the walls rest on tall (about four feet tall) concrete block walls, which in turn rest on poured concrete foundations
Gravel from the farm was used in making the poured concrete
Haimbaugh insisted on filling the block walls with poured concrete as well, in order to insure stability
The block walls still show no signs of failure
The original wooden shingles have been replaced by asphalt shingles
The roof has modest eaves with exposed rafters
Exterior frame walls are sheathed in vertical wood siding
Simple boards are used to frame door and window openings
The front is to the northeast
It has large sliding doors mounted on overhead tracks
The doors are vertical planks with an applied diamond panel decoration
The northwest side has a small human-sized door, allowing access without opening the large doors
A dormer is above the door
There are ten windows around each side of the barn from the main doors with another smaller door on the southeast side
There are no upper level windows on the front
A shed juts out from the rear of the barn with two windows and a single, upper level windows centered between the lower two
The shed has a series of ten windows, followed by a door and then another set of ten windows
== Interior ==

The interior of the barn is a composition of spaces arranged to facilitated the dairy operation
There is a central drive that runs from the main doors on the northeast and southwest
On either side of the main drive are feed alleys that are created by the central posts and a concrete feed trough, which forms a circle some 40 feet (12 m) in diameter
On the east side, a concrete trough is followed by a ring of support posts that brace a laminated beam above which helps to carry the weight of the floor joists
Stanchions for the milk herd are fitted between the posts, followed by a manure alley along the outer perimeter
The west side has a similar arrangement but there is a corncrib built into the middle of the feed alley
Finally, along the outer reaches of the west side, there are openings into the attached shed where pens could accommodate the storage of animals
The upper level, reached by a moveable ladder
The roofing system is an elaborate series of laminated beams and support posts that brace the three roof sections and the dormer
There is an upper laminated beam at the base of the metal aerator section that is braced by a series of cross-timbers that form a web of support
A circular hay track is mounted inside of this beam and it curves gracefully into the dormer thus allowing for efficient handling of hay and straw inside of the main doors
The roof trusses are then composed of balloon frame stick lumber pieces that radiate upwards toward the barn's center
The floor area of the upper level is open, with the exception of the area just inside of the northeast doors which is left open to accommodate loading and unloading of upper level feed
== Significance ==
It is associated with the development of agriculture in Indiana
The Haimbaugh Barn was built by locally prominent carpenters C
Kindig & Sons and features an unusual semi-circular attached shed section
The barn is an important and direct link to the agricultural development that occurred in Indiana from 1850 to 1936 and has changed very little since its construction in 1914
The period of greatest significance of the barn was from 1914 to 1936
The Haimbaugh barn is quite unusual and unique among Indiana examples
Being one of the 77 remaining true circular barns of the 151 that were built (219 round and polygonal barns were built in Indiana)
The barn is unique with the 20-foot (6
1 m)-deep shed that wraps halfway around the barn
Only one other Indiana example has this type of shed that was integral to the original design, the Dr
Horace Jones barn of Madison County's Boone Township
Furthermore, the decorative qualities of the barn and the attention to detail distinguish it from other examples, from its white trim to the diamond trimmed openings to the quarry-faced concrete block base
The Haimbaugh round barn has all of the essential features that were present at the time of its period of significance, from 1911 to the mid 1930s
== Owners ==
The original owner of the barn was John Haimbaugh who commissioned prominent Fulton County builders C
Kindig & Sons to erect the barn
Haimbaugh operated a dairy for which the barn seemed ideal
Timber was harvested from the farm and processed at the nearby Talma sawmill
Gravel for the concrete was mined from a nearby creek
After completion, there were 38 milking stations around the lower level and numerous windows providing ample light to the interior
The Haimbaugh family has always maintained ownership of the barn
The Haimbaugh Family Trust is the current owner
The trust was established for the maintenance of the barn

Welcome is an unincorporated community in King George County, Virginia, United States
The Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail (also known as the Warburton Trail) is a walking, cycling and horse-riding track in eastern Victoria, Australia
It runs a distance of 40 km (25 mi) between Lilydale and Warburton, along the former Warburton railway line in the Yarra Valley
The trail begins at Lilydale railway station and passes through the townships of Mount Evelyn, Wandin North, Seville, Seville East, Woori Yallock, Launching Place, Yarra Junction, Wesburn and Millgrove, ending at Warburton
== History ==
After the closure of the Warburton railway line in July 1965 and the dismantling of the track in the early 1970's, the land remained vacant
In 1984, and again in 1996, the state government investigated selling the land but withdrew the proposal, in part due to community opposition
Since its establishment in 1996, the trail has been continually developed and maintained by a combination of local volunteers, particularly the Friends of the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail, as well the Local Council and State and Federal governments
Over several years a significant amount of effort went into clearing the land, restoring 13 bridges and surfacing of the trail
Negotiations were undertaken with neighbouring farmers who had previously occupied the reserve, to erect fencing and gates where necessary
By 1998, the trail was continuous from the Maroondah Highway, Lilydale to the site of the former Warburton station, with only a relatively short section between Lilydale Station and Maroondah Highway remaining incomplete
The remaining section of the trail, including a bridge across the Maroondah Highway, was completed in early 2011
The next improvement to the trail is a crossing at York Road in Mount Evelyn, which should be completed mid-2011
== Deviation ==
Although the trail is continuous from Lilydale to Warburton, it does not completely adhere to the former Warburton rail line's alignment
Some 700 metres (2,300 ft) from Lilydale station, just before a historic bridge where the original alignment of Anderson Street passed over the railway, the trail deviates around the north, east and south of Mount Lilydale Mercy College
The school currently leases the land formerly occupied by the railway, which connects the old school grounds south-west of the line with an extension on the north-east
The southern end of the deviation rises to meet the original alignment of the trail at a steep grade that makes it unsuitable for wheelchairs

OmniOutliner is commercial outlining software for macOS and iOS produced by The Omni Group
OmniOutliner has most of the features of a conventional outliner, allowing the user to create nested lists of topics for almost any purpose, but has additional features extending its functionality beyond simple outlining
Recent versions of the software are  universal binaries
OmniOutliner received a special mention in the 2005 Apple Design Awards, and Macworld gave the "Professional" version its highest rating
== History ==
OmniOutliner 4 for Mac was released on January 15, 2014, with a modern redesign with new sidebars and a dynamic inspector, text zooming, smart match, date pasting logic, and more
OmniOutliner 2 for iOS was released alongside it
5 for Mac was released on March 2, 2016, a major update with more control printing selected rows, filtering indentation, export with tab separated indentation, and more
OmniOutliner 5 for Mac was released on April 5, 2017
OmniOutliner 3 for iOS was released in 2018
== Feature set ==


=== Outlining ===
OmniOutliner provides the basic functions of an outliner, structuring content in a hierarchy of rows indented under one another to show the relationships between different items
The user can expand or collapse outline levels for easy viewing, sort topics, promote or demote the level of a topic, or "hoist" one level so only that topic is shown
It supports considerable control over styles, allowing the user to make global changes to the appearance of the outline at particular level
It also permits the user to add notes to any row, which can be displayed in-line, (i
within the structure of the outline) or in a separate pane below the outline
OmniOutliner documents can incorporate multimedia elements, including images, audio, and video, as well as PDF documents and web links
In addition, OmniOutliner allows the addition of columns to the outline, so that the user can create rudimentary spreadsheets
There is limited support for summarizing columns, such as totaling or averaging, albeit not with anything close to the variety of functions provided in conventional spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel
OmniOutliner does not support cloning, a feature of some outliners that allows one topic to appear at more than one place in the outline
The Omni Group may, however, add this feature sometime in the future
=== Extensibility ===
OmniOutliner supports scripting via AppleScript, and users have extended the software to export to iCal, Apple's calendaring software, and even the iPod
=== Import and export ===
OmniOutliner's document format is proprietary, but it can export to OPML, HTML, DOCX, and several text and rich text formats
It can import from several other document formats (ACTA, MORE, Keynote, and Concurrence), as well as text and rich text formats

Demographics of the Victorian era refers to the demographics of the United Kingdom during the reign of Queen Victoria
== Demographic transition ==

Britain had the lead in rapid economic and population growth
At the time, Thomas Malthus believed this lack of growth outside Britain was due to the carrying capacity of their local environments
That is, the tendency of a population to expand geometrically while resources grew more slowly, reaching a crisis (such as famine, war, or epidemic) which would reduce the population to a more sustainable size
Great Britain escaped the 'Malthusian trap' because the scientific and technological breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution dramatically improved living standards, reducing mortality and increasing longevity
